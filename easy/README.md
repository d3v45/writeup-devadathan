Easy problems
### This is the beginner challenges i've sloved in WiredCTF - bi0s hardware's campus-wide recruitment programme

#### FLAG FORMAT:`wired{some_text}`
## da_french_cipher-[CRYPTO]
**How i approached it :-**

Identified the cipher as Vigenère cipher 

Found an online  decoder and gave the key according to given in the hint

decoded the flag!!

**What i learnt :-**

Understood what is french cipher 

The Vigenère cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of interwoven Caesar ciphers, based on the letters of a keyword. It employs a form of polyalphabetic substitution.

##  grep_it-[REVERSING]

Downloaded the junk file.

Opened the file in terminal

tried to read the file by opening with cat command

using grep command searched for wired and found out the flag!!

**What i learned from it :-**

Studied what is cat command 

It **reads data from the file and gives their content as output**

Studied what is grep command

**it is a command used in searching and matching text files contained in the regular expressions**

##  ain't_no_sunshine! -[OFFLINE HARDWARE]

A schematic of the connection to be made is provided in the attachments. 

The Required Hardware is provided.

Download the attachment and connected the components on the breadboard like given in attachment.

Connected the arduino to the laptop.

In Arduino IDE opened serial monitor and got the output flag!!

**What i learnt from it :-** 

Understood how to use Arduino IDE

##  find_thyself -[OSINT]

Downloaded the attachment

It was a power socket

by analyzing and researching, i found it is in Italy.

##  ~logic -[HARDWARE]

Downloaded the attachment of logic gate circuit

The output should be 1 

by analyzing found what are the inputs we wanted to give

By entering to the link given in description, entered to a simulation and gave name
after gave the same input values in the simulation and found the output flag!!

**What i learnt from it :-**

Improvede my logic gate input and output thinking level

## # chan's favorite
Downloaded the attachment audio (.wav) file
As per given in hint, i've imported it into audacity

Changed the track view into spectogram

got the flag look like an image on the track view.

**What i learnt from it :-** 

Interacted more with Audacity.

##  D0Z3N_IS_K3Y -[REVERSING]

Downloaded the junk file

Opened it in the Terminal

Using grep command search for flag

got a cipher text 

converted it in online and got the flag!!
