# Medium Problems

## Î¼Py_flag -[OFFLINE HARDWARE]
Analyzed what is **mirco python code in ESP8266.**
Connected the circuit to laptop.

At first Arduino IDE cannot able to read the circuit .

After making some changes, started to get output in serial monitor
We can brute-force the output by pressing the push button switch on the circuit.

After getting a proper output,

we can use python to get a cipher text

Ater converting it in online, we get the flag!!

**What i learnt from it: :-**

Improved my knowledge about Arduino IDE

##  I2C_F0R_LYF -[OFFLINE HARDWARE]
With the given components, Connected the SDA and SCL pins of both the boards.

Connected input of 5V.

Connected the circuit output to a logic analyzer and connected it intpo laptop.

I didn't get the output because at that time i don't know how to take output from Salae Logic Analyser properly.
